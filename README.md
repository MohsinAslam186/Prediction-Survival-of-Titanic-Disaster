Futher improvements:

The pipeline presented here is only intended to be a starting point. Many possibilities for improvement have not even been addressed here. 
For example, more data imputation possibilities could be explored. Instead of the RF classifier, one could try the XGBoost classifier or, 
for example, combine several classifiers with the help of a voting classifier. The cabin feature also offers potential for improvement. 
Instead of simply extracting the first two letters, the number of cabins booked could be a possible feature, since there are passengers who have booked more than one cabin.
You see, the possibilities are far from exploited.
